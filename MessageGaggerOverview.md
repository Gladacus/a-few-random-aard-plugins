# Editing the messages to be gagged #
A good deal of spellup messages are pre-loaded in the txt file downloaded using the directions below.  To add a message just copy and paste the entire message, one per line, onto a new line.  If you use 

&lt;deity&gt;

 it will automatically replace 

&lt;deity&gt;

 with the deity string you setup in the plugin.

# Download and installation. #
  1. Download the plugin file from here - http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Message_Gagger.xml.
  1. Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  1. Download the file containing the messages to gag from here - http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/messages_to_gag.txt
  1. Save the .txt file to your Muschlient Install folder.  It must be in the same folder as the mushclient.exe file.
  1. Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
